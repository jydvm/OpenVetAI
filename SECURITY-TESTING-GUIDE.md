# VetScribe Security Testing Guide

## 🧪 How to Test All Security Features

This guide shows you exactly how to test every security feature we've built into VetScribe.

## 🚀 Quick Start - Test Everything at Once

### **Method 1: Browser Console (Recommended)**
1. **Open VetScribe** in your browser
2. **Press F12** to open Developer Tools
3. **Click the "Console" tab**
4. **Type this command and press Enter:**
   ```javascript
   testSecurity()
   ```
5. **Watch the results** - you'll see a summary popup and detailed results in the console

### **Method 2: Individual Feature Tests**
Test each security feature separately:

```javascript
// Test encryption
testEncryption()

// Test data validation  
testDataValidation()

// Test privacy management
testPrivacyManagement()

// Test secure communication
testSecureCommunication()

// Quick status check
checkSecurityStatus()
```

## 🔐 Testing Encryption

### **What It Tests:**
- Browser crypto support
- Encryption initialization
- Data encryption/decryption
- Key generation and management

### **How to Test:**
```javascript
testEncryption()
```

### **Expected Results:**
- ✅ Browser supports encryption
- ✅ Encryption initialized successfully  
- ✅ Data encrypted and decrypted correctly
- Shows algorithm (AES-GCM) and key length (256 bits)

### **Manual Test:**
1. Go to **Settings tab**
2. Look for **"Enable Encryption"** toggle
3. Turn it **ON** with a password
4. Record a test SOAP note
5. Check that saved notes are encrypted in browser storage (F12 → Application → Local Storage)

## 🛡️ Testing Data Validation

### **What It Tests:**
- Patient information validation
- Malicious data detection
- SOAP note validation
- Security threat detection

### **How to Test:**
```javascript
testDataValidation()
```

### **Expected Results:**
- ✅ Good patient data accepted
- ✅ Malicious data blocked and sanitized
- ✅ SOAP notes validated correctly
- ✅ Security threats detected and removed

### **Manual Test:**
1. Try entering **malicious data** like: `Fluffy<script>alert("hack")</script>`
2. Check that it gets **sanitized** to just: `Fluffy`
3. Try invalid email formats
4. Check that warnings appear for invalid data

## 🔒 Testing Privacy Management

### **What It Tests:**
- Data retention policies
- Audit logging
- Automatic cleanup
- Privacy controls

### **How to Test:**
```javascript
testPrivacyManagement()
```

### **Expected Results:**
- ✅ Audit logging enabled
- ✅ Data minimization enabled
- ✅ Proper retention periods (SOAP: 7 years, Recordings: 90 days)
- ✅ Auto-delete policies active

### **Manual Tests:**

#### **Test Data Export:**
```javascript
exportUserData()
```
- Should download a JSON file with all your data

#### **Test Privacy Report:**
```javascript
exportPrivacyReport()
```
- Should download a compliance report

#### **Test Manual Cleanup:**
```javascript
performManualCleanup()
```
- Should remove expired data according to retention policies

## 🔒 Testing Secure Communication

### **What It Tests:**
- HTTPS enforcement
- URL validation
- Tailscale detection
- Request security

### **How to Test:**
```javascript
testSecureCommunication()
```

### **Expected Results:**
- ✅ HTTPS URLs accepted
- ✅ Tailscale URLs (100.x.x.x) accepted
- ✅ HTTP URLs correctly rejected
- Shows connection quality and security status

### **Manual Test:**
1. Go to **Settings**
2. Try entering different LLM endpoints:
   - `https://example.com` (should work)
   - `http://example.com` (should warn about security)
   - `http://100.64.1.1:1234` (Tailscale - should work)

## 📊 Understanding Test Results

### **Success Indicators:**
- **✅ PASS** - Feature working correctly
- **ℹ️ INFO** - Informational status
- **❌ FAIL** - Feature needs attention

### **Success Rates:**
- **90%+** - Excellent security
- **75-89%** - Good security  
- **50-74%** - Fair security (needs improvement)
- **Below 50%** - Poor security (requires immediate attention)

## 🔍 Quick Security Status Check

### **Fastest Way to Check Everything:**
```javascript
checkSecurityStatus()
```

This gives you an instant overview:
- 🔐 Encryption status
- 🔒 HTTPS status  
- 🛡️ Data validation status
- 🔒 Privacy management status
- 📊 Overall security score

## 🚨 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### **"Encryption module not available"**
- **Cause:** Browser doesn't support Web Crypto API
- **Fix:** Use Chrome, Firefox, or Safari; ensure HTTPS

### **"HTTPS disabled"**
- **Cause:** Using HTTP instead of HTTPS
- **Fix:** Access via HTTPS or use Tailscale

### **"Data validation failed"**
- **Cause:** Module didn't load properly
- **Fix:** Refresh page, check browser console for errors

### **"Privacy management not available"**
- **Cause:** Module didn't load
- **Fix:** Check that all JavaScript files loaded correctly

- 📊 Overall Security: EXCELLENT

## 🆘 Getting Help

If tests fail or you see unexpected results:

1. **Check the browser console** (F12) for detailed error messages
2. **Try refreshing** the page and running tests again
3. **Verify you're using HTTPS** (not HTTP)
4. **Check that you're using a modern browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
5. **Look for JavaScript errors** that might prevent modules from loading

The security system is designed to be robust, so most issues are related to browser compatibility or network configuration rather than the security code itself.
