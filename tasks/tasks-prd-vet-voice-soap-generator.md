- `styles.css` - CSS file for clean, modern styling with mobile-first design
- `app.js` - Main JavaScript file containing application logic and UI interactions
- `audio-recorder.js` - Module for handling voice recording using Web Audio API
- `transcription.js` - Module for converting audio to text
- `llm-connector.js` - Module for connecting to LM Studio via Tailscale and communicating with local LLMs
- `soap-generator.js` - Module for processing transcripts and generating SOAP notes
- `storage.js` - Module for local storage of transcripts and SOAP notes
- `utils.js` - Utility functions for file export, encryption, and general helpers
- `tests/audio-recorder.test.js` - Unit tests for audio recording functionality

### Notes

- Unit tests should be placed in a `tests/` directory to keep the main application files clean
- Use a simple test framework like Jest or a lightweight browser-based testing approach
- The application will be a single-page web application using vanilla JavaScript for simplicity
- Architecture designed to support future data ownership and learning capabilities
- LM Studio + Tailscale approach prioritizes ease of setup for non-technical veterinarians
- Data schema designed to be extensible for future LangChain integration
